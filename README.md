# Kubernetes-Lightweight-Quickstart
Quickstart on using K3S

### Abstract

Throughout my career there has been endless change and as a result endless learning.
I enjoy the challenge. Recently, I decided to refine my Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
skills by creating a project with the intent to write a simple how-to mixing Terradata (OpenTofu)
with KinD (Kubernetes in Docker) and a deployment of microservice using OpenFaaS Community Edition (CE).
The end result is documented at https://fraserswaxway.github.io/tofu-quick-start/ and all the files are
at https://github.com/fraserswaxway/tofu-quick-start. Most [somewhat] technical people should be
able to use the provided files and see a result in around 30 minutes.

### 1. Introduction <a id="introduction"/>


[K3s](https://docs.k3s.io/) is a lightweight version of Kubernetes (K3s) which runs on most modern 
Linux operating systems ([Requirements](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/requirements)).  
It is quick and easy to install. Installation of K3s directly with LXC (Linux Container) can be move involved 
([Mills, 2022](https://garrettmills.dev/blog/2022/04/18/Rancher-K3s-Kubernetes-on-Proxmox-Container/)).

quick to install 
Lightweight Kubernetes. Easy to install, half the memory, all in a binary of less than 100 MB.

Most human communication is sensory based. Block senses and
most communication is prevented. Many organizations practice
blocking senses to protect information. Most are familiar
the use of distance, walls, rooms, doors, curtains,
and soundproofing as physical barriers. Languages and codes
can also be barriers.
